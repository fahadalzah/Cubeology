            <p>In the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts
                and Crafts in Budapest. Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to
                help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving
                the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had
                created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it.Magic Cube
                was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle from being easily pulled
                apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi
                took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.</p>

            <p>Ernő Rubik (Hungarian: rubik ɛrnø; born 13 July 1944) is a Hungarian inventor, architect, and professor
                of
                architecture. He is best known for the invention of mechanical puzzles including the Rubik's Cube
                (1974),
                Rubik's Magic, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition, and Rubik's Snake.

                While Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik's Cube and his other puzzles, much of his recent work
                involves
                the promotion of science in education. Rubik is involved with several organizations such as Beyond
                Rubik's Cube,
                the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation all of whose aim is to engage students in
                science,
                mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.

            <p> Spin Master acquired the brand in 2021. Their latest brainteaser is called the Phantom, which takes the
                3×3 original cube and adds a memory test: Using thermochromic technology, the multi-color tiles revert
                to black unless the heat of the user’s hand keeps them visible.“The principle of the cube is not
                limited,” says Rubik. “The complexity of the task is to stimulate our mind and it makes it a much more
                enjoyable activity.”

                The goal of all Rubik puzzles is to start with some randomized and shuffled messy configuration and, by
                rotating faces or parts, transform each side into a single color or a pattern of colors.</p>
